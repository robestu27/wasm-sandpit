1)  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Rust_to_wasm
-- Installed wasm-pack

    cargo install wasm-pack

--  Setup Cargo.toml as per demo, put in test code, ran

    wasm-pack build --target web


-- 404 because I needed to change the index.html to use the filename produced by my project, 
-- which is "wasm_sandpit" rather than "hello_wasm" as per the example on msdn.


2) https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/examples/2d-canvas.html
-- Copied code from the page (lib.rs)
-- updated Cargo.toml with extra dependencies etc as per page
-- Amended mt page -- not the import  changes from "greet" to "start" to reflect the function name change
-- Ran wasm-pack and lauched it -->  I get the smiley face!



-- This guy did what want to!!

1) "Euclid" gives various structs for 2d/3d vector logic
2) femtovg looks like reasonable start to get app working in 1st instance
3) https://physics.princeton.edu//~fpretori/Nbody/intro.htm

4) You can google "G" the gravitation constants, and others
        6.674×10−11 m3⋅kg−1⋅s−2
        solarmass=1.98892 x 10 ^ 30 kg;
        earth 5.972 × 10^24 kg
        moon 7.34767309 × 10^22 kg

5) We'd need speed(velocity) and distance of sun-to-earth and earth-to-moon
