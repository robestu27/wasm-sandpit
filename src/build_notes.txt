1)  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Rust_to_wasm
-- Installed wasm-pack

    cargo install wasm-pack

--  Setup Cargo.toml as per demo, put in test code, ran

    wasm-pack build --target web


-- 404 because I needed to change the index.html to use the filename produced by my project, 
-- which is "wasm_sandpit" rather than "hello_wasm" as per the example on msdn.


2) https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/examples/2d-canvas.html
-- Copied code from the page (lib.rs)
-- updated Cargo.toml with extra dependencies etc as per page
-- Amended mt page -- not the import  changes from "greet" to "start" to reflect the function name change
-- Ran wasm-pack and lauched it -->  I get the smiley face!
